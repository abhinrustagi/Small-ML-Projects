# Face Recognition using OpenCV
This is a basic face recognition project built on OpenCV library, and its [haarcascade frontal face classifier](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml). It stores data as a numpy array, with extension as '.npy'. 

- face_capture.py : This file is used to add and store data to the classifier.
- face_test.py : This file is used to classify the face.
